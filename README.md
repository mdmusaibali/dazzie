### Sass (scss)

Some useful and basic scss files are stored in "src/sass" folder. The main.scss file in this folder imports all the other scss files so that this main.scss file can be linked to index.html/index.js

i)\_variables.scss: contains some color variables. These variables are used throughout the other scss files. This pattern helps in implementing themes later.

ii)\_base.scss: contains base configurations such as margin and padding resetting, font size initialisation and setting box properties.

iii)\_typography.scss: contains typography styles such as font family, base font color and etc.

iv) Each component has it's style file associated with it with the same name. This is done for easy debugging
